# Relational-Database
I designed and implemented a relational database to store and manage data on past NFL games, players, and team statistics. The database schema included normalized tables for games, teams, players, and team scores. I connected the database to a front-end website using C++, MySQL, and PHP, allowing users to view, search, and filter information based upon player name, conference, date, or team matchups. However, the website does not work anymore since it was hosted on the University of Arkansas's web service which I no longer have due to me not being a student anymore.
