# Relational-Database
I designed and implemented a relational database to store and manage data on past NFL games, players, and team statistics. The database schema included normalized tables for games, teams, players, and team scores. I connected the database to a front-end website using C++, MySQL, and PHP, allowing users to view, search, and filter information based on player name, conference, date, or team matchups. However, the database is no longer functional since it was hosted on the University of Arkansas's web service, which I no longer have access to due to my status as an alumnus.
